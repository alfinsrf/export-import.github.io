## ðŸ“ŒInformation
This is a company profile website of Alfarizna export and import company. This is my personal project to improve my skills in front-end development. I created this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In working on the CSS, I created it with SCSS syntax which makes it easy for me to divide the work into several files modularly so that it is easier to read. I also use an extension from VS Code called Live Sass Compiler which really helps me in creating CSS files, just click the Watch my Sass button and the extension will do its job of creating a CSS file mapping every time I save the SCSS file in the project.

I also created this website with two themes, namely a light theme and a dark theme that can be switched using JavaScript. In JavaScript there is also a function to store the value of the theme used in local storage so that the theme used last time will be used again by checking when the website is opened, so that the theme remains the same the next time. The website has also been made responsive so that it can be opened properly via mobile, tablet, or laptop by creating several rules using media queries at a minimum and maximum certain width.
